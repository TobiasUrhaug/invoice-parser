Check if `comments.md` exists and has content.

- If it does, read it in full and address every comment following the developer workflow in `.claude/profiles/developer.md` (step 4).
- If it does not exist or is empty, move to step 1 of the developer workflow: pick up the next task and implement it using TDD as described in `.claude/profiles/developer.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
