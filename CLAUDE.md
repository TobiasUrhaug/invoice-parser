# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Python project for parsing invoices. Currently in initial setup — no source code, build system, or package manager has been configured yet.

The `.gitignore` includes entries for Ruff, mypy, pytest, and common Python virtual environment tools (uv, Poetry, PDM, Pipenv, Pixi), but none have been configured yet.

## Setup

Once a package manager and build system are chosen, update this file with:
- How to install dependencies
- How to run the project
- How to run tests (including a single test)
- How to lint and type-check
